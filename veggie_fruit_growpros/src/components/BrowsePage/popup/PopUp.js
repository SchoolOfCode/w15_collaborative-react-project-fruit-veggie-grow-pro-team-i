      paragraph="Cherry tomatoes range in size from a thumbtip to the size of a golf ball. Their shape ranges from spherical to slightly oblong to pointed at the bottom. They are often red, but can also be yellow, green, striped, and even black. More oblong cherry tomatoes often share characteristics with plum tomatoes, and are known as grape tomatoes.

They are delicious for snacking, in salads, lightly roasted or grilled, or baked. They require little to no pruning unlike larger tomato plants."

There are three main types of strawberries: 1) summer-fruiting: produce a single, large crop of fruit the year after planting. To grow, transplant plugs or crowns in early spring in rows spaced at least 120cm apart. Pinch off all flowers the first season and train the plant's runners, pressing them into the soil 15-22cm apart from the mother plant. Mulch with straw or pine needles in the fall when the plants have died back. When the plants start to grow back in the spring, move the mulch aside. After harvest the second season, set a lawnmower to about 10cm high and mow, being sure not to damage crowns."
